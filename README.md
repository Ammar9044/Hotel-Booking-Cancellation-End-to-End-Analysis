Hotel Bookings Cancellation Analysis ‚Äî Hospitality Data Insights
Portfolio Project | Hospitality Analytics | SQL | Tableau
üöÄ About This Project
This project delivers a robust analysis of hotel reservations and cancellations with the aim of understanding guest behavior, operational challenges, and opportunities for improvement. Using structured SQL cleaning, in-depth analytical queries, and interactive Tableau visualizations, this analysis uncovers what drives cancellations, when they happen, and which guest segments or markets are most affected.

My goal: transform complex booking data into clear, actionable insights for hotel managers and data professionals.

üéØ What I Set Out to Do
Analyze overall and segment-specific cancellation rates for hotels

Identify high-risk market segments, time periods, and geographies for cancellations

Examine patterns in booking characteristics such as lead time, ADR, special requests, and guest count

Find actionable insights to reduce cancellations and optimize booking strategy

üßπ How I Worked With The Data
Cleaned and transformed raw data using SQL scripts to remove duplicates, fix missing/invalid values, and engineer new features

Explored trends, rates, and relationships through targeted SQL EDA queries

Communicated results via interactive Tableau dashboard for effortless exploration and stakeholder engagement

üîç Key Takeaways & Corresponding Recommendations
Cancellation Rate in 2017: 31.84%, with a 10,000 canceled bookings out of 31,408 (down from previous year)

Highest Risk Segment: Online travel agency bookings showed the highest cancellation rate (39.62%)

Recommendation: Strengthen communication and flexible policies for OTA guests, and consider incentives for direct bookings

Seasonality: Cancellations peaked in August, suggesting tighter controls or promotional interventions are needed for this period

Geography: Certain countries exhibited higher cancellation rates, indicating a need for market-specific strategies

Recommendation: Target high-cancellation countries with tailored offers or stricter booking requirements

Booking Characteristics: Longer lead times and lower ADR bookings tended to cancel more frequently

Recommendation: Implement prepayment or deposit requirements for risk-prone bookings

üõ† Tools I Used
SQL (MySQL) for data cleaning and exploratory analysis

Tableau for dashboard creation and visualization
