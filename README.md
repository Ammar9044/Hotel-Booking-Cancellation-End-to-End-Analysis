🏨 Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis

Portfolio Project | Hospitality Analytics | SQL | Tableau

🚀 Project Overview

This project analyzes hotel reservations and cancellations to uncover guest behavior patterns, operational challenges, and opportunities for improvement. Using SQL for data cleaning & analysis and Tableau for visualization, the goal was to turn complex booking data into clear, actionable insights for hotel managers and data professionals.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze overall and segment-specific cancellation rates

Identify high-risk market segments, time periods, and geographies

Examine booking characteristics such as lead time, ADR, special requests, and guest count

Recommend strategies to reduce cancellations and optimize bookings

🧹 Data Preparation

Cleaned and transformed raw hotel booking data using SQL scripts

Handled duplicates, missing values, and invalid entries

Engineered new features (e.g., weekday/month of booking, cancellation flags)

Performed EDA with SQL to explore trends, rates, and correlations

🔍 Key Insights & Recommendations

Overall Cancellation Rate (2017): 31.84%
➝ 10,000 out of 31,408 bookings canceled (lower than previous year)

Highest Risk Segment: Online Travel Agency (OTA) cancellations at 39.62%
➝ Recommendation: Improve OTA guest communication, flexible policies, and incentivize direct bookings

Seasonality: Cancellations peak in August
➝ Recommendation: Introduce promotions or stricter controls during high-risk months

Geography: Certain countries showed disproportionately high cancellations
➝ Recommendation: Apply tailored offers or stricter booking requirements by market

Booking Characteristics: Longer lead times and lower ADR bookings cancel more often
➝ Recommendation: Require deposits/prepayments for high-risk bookings
